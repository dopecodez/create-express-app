We welcome patches and features. For any new features added, please make sure we add a unit test to it.

## How to setup a local copy

Clone the project, run `npm i` and then `npm link` to setup a local copy which you can change. This is helpful so that you can work on it and test it iteratively without having to continually rebuild.

## How to improve available templates

In case you feel like any of the templates could use any extra features, raise an issue first before you raise a PR. We can discuss any ideas and which would be the right way to implement.

## Running test cases

Make sure your PR passes all the tests by running `npm test` before raising a PR.
